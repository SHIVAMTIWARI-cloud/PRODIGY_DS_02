# PRODIGY_DS_02
The goal of this project is to clean the dataset and perform detailed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to discover insights, identify trends, and understand the relationship between features like survival status, gender, passenger class, age, etc.

🚢 Titanic Dataset: Data Cleaning & Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
This project is part of the Prodigy Infotech Data Science Internship - Task 2. It focuses on performing data cleaning, handling missing values, and conducting thorough Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset.

📁 Dataset
The dataset used in this project is from the Kaggle Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster challenge, provided in the Prodigy Infotech GitHub Dataset.
It contains information about passengers such as:

Name, Age, Sex

Ticket, Cabin, Fare

Passenger Class

Whether they survived or not

📌 Objectives
Load and merge the training and test data

Clean the data (handle missing values, drop irrelevant features)

Perform univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis

Visualize trends and patterns (e.g., survival rates by gender, class, age)

Export the cleaned dataset

📊 Key Findings
Female passengers had significantly higher survival rates.

First-class passengers were more likely to survive than second or third class.

Age and family relations had subtle but visible influence on survival.

🛠️ How to Run
Clone the repository or download the .ipynb notebook.

Open the notebook in Jupyter Notebook or any compatible platform (e.g., Colab, VS Code).

Run the cells sequentially.
